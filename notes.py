I do not own the pictures, I simply provide for you a connection
from your Discord server to Gelbooru using both legal and free APIs.

I am not responsible in any way for the content that GelBot will send to
the chat. Keep in mind YOU are the one who type the tags.
"""

help = """
The usage of GelBot is simple. Here's only one command that you need to
get pictures. !pic is what you need. Syntax:

!pic [optional rating] tag/tag with a space/tag/tag

Type !gelexamples to get better grasp of the command.

Type !gelratings if you don't know how to use ratings.

Please type !gelnote and read my disclaimer.
"""

examples = """
Some examples of !pic usage:
!pic rs lucy heartfilia
!pic lucy heartfilia/cat ears/long hair
!pic aqua (konosuba)
!pic rs misaka mikoto/animal ears/sweater
!pic rq kitchen
"""

ratings = """
We've got 3 ratings available:
rs - rating safe - mostly SFW content,
rq - rating questionable - mostly NSFW, well questionable content,
re - rating explicit - definitely unquestionable NSFW content.

For both rating questionable and explicit NSFW channel is required.

If you don't specify any, GelBot will look only within rating safe.
